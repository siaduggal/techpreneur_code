         <h5 class="text" style="text-align:right;">
           Our product provides a beneficial and economically viable solution to stubble burning. The consequences of stubble burning impact farmers directly. Along with the numerous respiratory and oncologic health hazards posed by the severe deterioration in air quality, continual burning also leeches essential minerals and nutrients out of the soil. In the long term, the cost of healthcare and fertilizers can be economically disadvantageous for small scale farmers, and cause many other environmental problems in the surrounding areas.<br><br>
  Our product provides an opportunity for farmers to not just dramatically cut down on the discussed expenditures, but also produce a profit on what they would consider waste; our calculations estimate this to reach up to 1.44 Lakh for an average farm. This, combined with the several cashback schemes under development are a compelling financial incentive for investment in B3. In addition, they will no longer be restricted by government regulations on stubble burning to govern their livelihoods. Rather, they can operate within the law to benefit both society and themselves.

         <h5 class="text"> It is no secret- for decades now, our government has been in search of a solution to mitigate stubble burning. While a single product may not result in the reform required to completely eradicate the problem, our idea holds infinite potential to facilitate this transition. The best method does not involve legislature- it is through empowering the everyday farmer, and providing an opportunity for them to improve their lives and businesses in an economically viable and sustainable way. This is achieved through B3.<br><br>
Furthermore, government subsidies and cashback schemes make our product cheaper for farmers, further incentivizing them to take the initial jump.
This has the potential to make our product a truly powerful solution to stubble burning that is not just efficient and productive, but also accessible.
Investing in B3 is the first and most necessary step to resolving an environmental and social issue of such complexity, without compromise on either side.

         <h5 class="text" style="text-align:right;">Let every acre be x <br>
 Thus, 31000 + 6500x = (16500+9500)x <br>
 -> x=0.84 Acres <br>
 Thus, a farmer would break even at 0.84 Acres with the help of our product</h5>

         <h5 class="text">
           Average Farm in Punjab - 3.62 Hectares <br>
3.62 Hectares = 8.95 Acres, so <br>
Cost = 31000+6500(8.95) = 89175 Rupees <br>
Benefit = 43500(8.95) = 389300 Rupees <br>

Profit = 232700-89175 = 389300 Rupees <br>

Thus, a single Average Punjab Farm could make 3.89 Lakhs of Profit using our device!
